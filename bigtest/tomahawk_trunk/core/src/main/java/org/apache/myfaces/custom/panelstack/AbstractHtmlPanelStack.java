/**
 * A stack of panels, to switch panels dynamically. 
 * 
 * Manage a stack of JSF components and allow for one child component to be choosen for rendering. The behaviour
 * is similar to the CardLayout of Java Swing. Property <code>selectedPanel</code> defines the id of the child
 * to be rendered. If no child panel is selected or if the selected panel can not be found the first child is rendered.
 * 
 * Unless otherwise specified, all attributes accept static values or EL expressions.
