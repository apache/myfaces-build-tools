            <p>Some users have reported problems when using MyFaces wtth Tomcat5.5.x. Here is a short guide that will hopefully help you not run into the same problems :-)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If your are using the binary version of MyFaces: MyFaces is packaged so that it works with Tomcat5.0.x so the <code>WEB-INF/lib/jsp-2.0.jar</code> and <code>WEB-INF/lib/commons-el.jar</code> JAR files must be removed from your WAR files (including the examples).</li>
                <li>If you are building from source: If you want to build MyFaces from scratch to work with Tomcat 5.5.x, you have to set the property <code>tomcat.pre.5.5.version</code> in the <code>$MYFACES_HOME/build/build.default.properties</code> file to the value <code>false</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We hope this helps, if not please contact the user list at <a href="mailto:users@myfaces.apache.org">MyFaces</a>!</p>
        </section>
        <section name="Tomcat 4.x">
            <p>MyFaces has a dependency on some of the classes in the JSP2.0 spec. As a result applications based on MyFaces will not run without the inclusion of the jsp-2.0.jar file in the <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> directory of your <code>.war</code> file.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Place the relevant myfaces jars in <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/shared/lib</code>.</li>
                <li>Place the following supporting jars in <code>$TOMCAT_HOME/shared/lib</code>: commons-beanutils.jar, commons-codec.jar,
                    commons-digester.jar and commons-fileupload.jar.
