  - This project uses a custom plugin to process metadata held by this project and generate
  - a jarfile that contains just config data. The main api and impl projects then run a plugin
  - against this jarfile in order to generate various jsf-specific artifacts, including:
  -   * jsf component classes
  -   * jsp taglib classes
  -   * a faces-config file
  -
  - This is done because JSF has a lot of "boilerplate" type code: 
  -  * Component classes have getters and setters for many properties.
  -  * There is a JSP tag class for each component, with exactly the same
  -    properties, and code that just passes the data through to the component
  -    class in a very standard manner.
  -  * A JSP taglib file must then declare the same properties in xml tags
  -  * A JSF faces-config.xml file must declare each component
  -
  - If you want to improve the documentation for a public property of a JSF component,
  - then the meta-data files in this project is where it needs to be done.
