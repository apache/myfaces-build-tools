 * A simple class that contains locale-specific constants used for date
 * parsing and formatting.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this can be created, and the symbols modified before
 * passing it to a SimpleDateFormatter. This allows date formatting and
 * parsing to be localised.
 * <p>
 * The standard Java DateFormatSymbols class could be used directly by
 * SimpleDateFormatter, making this class unnecessary. However javascript
 * does not have an equivalent class built-in, so to keep symmetry between
 * the java and javascript versions we have one here too.
