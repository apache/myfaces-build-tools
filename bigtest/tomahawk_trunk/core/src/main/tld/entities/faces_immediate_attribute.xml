        A boolean value that identifies the phase during which action events
        should fire. During normal event processing, action methods and
        action listener methods are fired during the "invoke application"
        phase of request processing. If this attribute is set to "true",
        these methods are fired instead at the end of the "apply request
        values" phase.
