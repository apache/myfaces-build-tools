Hosted QA

 <<{{{http://www.hostedqa.com}HostedQA}}>> is a web-based quality assurance
 solution from <<{{{http://www.autoriginate.com/}Autoriginate}}>>, which has
 generously donated an account to MyFaces.

 MyFaces uses HostedQA to run {{{selenium.html}Selenium}} tests against the
 example apps.

 The following example apps have Selenium tests available at HostedQA:

  * MyFaces Example Simple

* Configure

 To execute the tests remotely at HostedQA, MyFaces committers will need to
 supply an email address and a password.

 (If you don't have a password, ask on the developers list.)

 You can add this information to your ~/.m2/settings.xml file.

 settings.xml:

+-----+
       <profile>
         <id>hostedqa</id>
         <properties>
            <myfaces.hostedqa.email>your-id@apache.org</myfaces.hostedqa.email>
            <myfaces.hostedqa.password>your-password</myfaces.hostedqa.password>
         </properties>
       </profile>
+-----+

* Execute Tests

 The {{{http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/myfaces/tomahawk/trunk/examples/pom.xml
?view=markup}tomahawk-examples-project pom}} includes a 'hostedqa' profile that
 will

  * upload the example application to HostedQA, and

  * execute the Selenium tests, remotely.

  []

  In addition, the pom for each example app includes a 'hostedqa' profile that
  defines which resource, client, and application configuration should be used.
  The 

 With an email address and password configured in settings.xml, execute the tests
 as follows

+-----+
 $ mvn package -P hostedqa
+-----+

 Alternately, you can supply your email address and password on the command line:

+-----+
 $ mvn package -P hostedqa -Dhostedqa.email=<your-id>@apache.org -Dhostedqa.password=<your-password>
+-----+
