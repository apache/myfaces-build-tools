     * A JSF implementation is expected to provide a full implementation of this
     * class. However JSF also explicitly allows user code to apply the "decorator"
     * pattern to this type, by overriding the FacesContextFactory class. In that
     * pattern, the decorating class has a reference to an "underlying" implementation
     * and forward calls to it, possibly after taking other related actions.
     * <p>
     * The decorator pattern does have difficulties with backwards-compatibility when
     * new methods are added to the class being decorated, as with this method which
     * was added in JSF1.2. Decorator classes that were written for JSF1.1 will subclass
     * this class, but will not override this method to pass the call on to the 
     * "underlying" instance. This base implementation therefore must do that for it.
     * <p>
     * Unfortunately the JSF designers stuffed up the design; this base class has no way
     * of knowing what the "underlying" instance is! The current implementation here
     * is therefore to delegate directly to the very <i>first</i> FacesContext instance
     * registered within this request (via setCurrentInstance). This instance should
     * be the "full" implementation provided by the JSF framework. The drawback is that
     * when any decorator class is present which defaults to this base implementation,
     * then any following decorator instances that do override this method do not get
     * it invoked.
     * <p>
     * It is believed that the Sun JSF implementation (Mojarra) does something similar.
