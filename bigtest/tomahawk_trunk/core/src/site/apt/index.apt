 Apache MyFaces - Tomahawk
 ------

MyFaces Tomahawk

  MyFaces provides a series of JSF components that go beyond the JSF specification.  These components are 100% compatible
  with the Sun JSF 1.1 Reference Implementation (RI) or any other JSF 1.1 compatible implementation.  Of course the custom
  components can also be used with the Apache MyFaces JSF implementation.
  
  Although we try to make Tomahawk as "portable" as possible, not all Tomahawk releases are compatible with all
  MyFaces or Sun Mojarra (formerly RI) releases. A Tomahawk release is always compatible with the latest MyFaces
  Core release available at the time that Tomahawk version was released. For further information on compatibility
  between Tomahawk and other frameworks/libraries, please see the 
  {{{http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/CompatibilityMatrix}relevant wiki page}}.

Extended Components and Other "Goodies"

  In addition to custom components not found in the JSF specification, the MyFaces components bundle also includes an
  "extended" version of some of the default components. These are basically components that exist in either the core or
  html tag libraries but additional functionality has been addded that goes beyond the specification.

  * Example: \<t:inputText\> - This is similar to the \<h:inputText\> component but it provides additional attributes
  such as <<<forceId>>>.  When this attribute is <<<true>>> the HTML generated will used the id
  specified by the <code>id</code> attribute instead of the one normally generated by following the JSF specification.

  * Converters - MyFaces components project contains several custom objects that do not implement <<<UIComponent>>>.
   Some of these include objects that implement the <<<Converter>>> interface.

  []

  * Tiles Support - MyFaces provides a custom solution to allow the use of Tiles and JSF together.

Requirements and Setup
        
  * Put the <<<tomahawk.jar>>> in your <<<WEB-INF/lib>>> directory (or in the classpath of your
  application server.)

  * Configure the {{{extensionsFilter.html}MyFaces Extensions filter}} in your <<<WEB-INF/web.xml>>> file.

  * Add the following to your JSP page in order to use one of the MyFaces custom components:\
  <<<\<%@ taglib uri="http://myfaces.apache.org/tomahawk" prefix="t" %\>>>>

  * That's it! You're good to go.
