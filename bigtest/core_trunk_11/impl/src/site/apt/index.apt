MyFaces Core 1.1 Implementation Project

  This Implementation submodule implements all of the classes that are needed to 
  provide the functionality of the JSF specification, but which are not public
  classes, ie which should not directly be invoked by user code.

  None of the classes in this project are in the javax.faces namespace.
