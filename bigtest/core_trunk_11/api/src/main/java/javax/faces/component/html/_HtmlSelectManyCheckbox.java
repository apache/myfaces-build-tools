/**
 * Allow the user to select zero or more items from a set of
 * available options. This is presented as a table with one cell per
 * available option; each cell contains a checkbox and the option's
 * label. The "layout" attribute determines whether the checkboxes
 * are laid out horizontally or vertically.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The set of available options is defined by adding child
 * f:selectItem or f:selectItems components to this component.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The value attribute must be a value-binding expression to a
 * property of type List, Object array or primitive array. That
 * "collection" is expected to contain objects of the same type as
 * SelectItem.getValue() returns for the child SelectItem objects.
 * On rendering, any child whose value is in the list will be
 * selected initially. During the update phase, the property setter
 * is called to replace the original collection with a completely
 * new collection object of the appropriate type. The new collection
 * object contains the value of each child SelectItem object that
 * is currently selected.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Unless otherwise specified, all attributes accept static values
 * or EL expressions.
